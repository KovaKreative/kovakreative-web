export const aboutContent = [<p>My love of programming grew out of my childhood obsession with seeing how things are made and how they work. <span className='sm'>As a toddler, all of my toys were broken because I would take them apart to see what was on the inside. As I grew older, </span>I developed a love and fascination with software through Video Games. To have a character show up on my TV screen, and then to take control over it and have agency over what it does was sheer sorcery!</p>,
<p>Through my <span className='sm'>adolescence and into my </span>teenage years, I tinkered with user-friendly video game engines like RPG Maker, which <span className='sm'>didn’t use real coding but still </span>managed to teach me programming concepts such as variables and conditional statements. My first <span className='sm'>real </span>experience with programming was when I enrolled in Computer Science class in high school, building applets using JavaScript. I took to it immediately and ended up getting the Grade 11 Computer Science Award that year.</p>,
<p>Since then, I have studied and practiced a number of disciplines, including Visual Arts, Acting, Music Composition, and Photography – I’m a lifelong learner and polymath.</p>, 
<p>After completing a robust Web Development course on Udemy, I ended up working as a Freelance Web Developer for over 5 years while part-timing as an instructor of JavaScript and Visual Arts. I’m also a passionate Video Game Designer and Developer.</p>,
<p>Wanting to turn my love of coding and Web Development into a full time career, I enrolled into Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp, where I had the pleasure of immersing myself in an intensive learning experience, which helped me to further develop my knowledge.</p>,
<p>As a Web Developer, I strive to use my eclectic interests by applying their philosophies and principles to help me solve coding problems and develop intuitive, engaging, and efficiently built products.</p>];
