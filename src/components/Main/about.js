  "My love of programming grew out of my childhood obsession with seeing how things are made and how they work. As a toddler, all of my toys were broken because I would take them apart to see what was on the inside. As I grew older, I developed a love and fascination with software through Video Games. To have a character show up on my TV screen and then to take control of it and move it around was sheer sorcery!",
  "Through my adolescence and into my teenage years, I spent dozens of hours tinkering with user-friendly video game engines like RPG Maker 2000, which introduced me to programming concepts such as variables and conditional statements. My first real experience with programming was in Grade 11 Computer Science class, building applets using JavaScript. I took to it immediately and ended up getting the Grade 11 Computer Science Award that year.",
  "Since then, I have studied and practiced a number of disciplines, including Visual Arts, Acting, Music Composition, and Photography – I’m a lifelong learner and polymath.",
  "After completing a robust Web Development course on Udemy, I started working as a Freelancer, building websites for clients for over 5 years while part-timing as a Programming and Visual Arts Instructor.",
  "Wanting to turn my love of coding and Web Development into a full time career, I enrolled into Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp, where I had the pleasure of immersing myself in an intensive learning experience, which helped me to further develop my knowledge.",
  "Since then, I have worked with great teams on several ambitious projects, where aside from continuing to develop my hard skills and learning new tools, I had the honour of being appointed Team Lead and Project Manager.",
  "As a Software Developer, I strive to use my eclectic interests by applying their philosophies and principles to help me solve coding problems and develop intuitive, engaging, and efficiently built products."
